PLUG Notes

Transforming your Android phone into a notebook. Take pictures instead of typing out text and covert them to digital, editable text.

Current OCR being used is Tesseract. Will be migrating to web-based OCR given the time.

Tech:
1. Paperless note-taking
2. Integrated OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine
3. Cloud storage for notes (see plug-notes-web)
